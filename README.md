Let's do a simple try-catch application in this practice.

Write a program that asks the user to enter a number. When the user enters a valid number, print the square of that number on the screen.

If the user enters an invalid input (such as entering a letter or symbol instead of a number), display an error message such as "Invalid input! Please enter a number."
